# blip-01

The `blip-01` is a simple device that I designed.

It is based on the Raspberry Pico W and has a 128x160 TFT display with a ST7735 controller.
It also has 4 buttons and a buzzer.

# Goals for the device
- [x] Build a simple device that I can program in C/C++.
- [x] Run a simple Tetris game on it.
- [ ] Display data fetched from a server using the HTTP protocol.
- [ ] Play music using the buzzer. (maybe the background music for the Tetris game?)
- [ ] Design and 3D print a case for the device using Fusion 360.

# Things I learned along the way
- How to solder components to a perfboard.
- How SPI communication works.
- How to use PlatformIO to build and flash code to the Raspberry Pico W.
- How to organize my code in a way that is both modular and easy to understand.
